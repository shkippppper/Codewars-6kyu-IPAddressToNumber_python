An IPv4 address is a 32-bit number that identifies a device on the internet.

While computers read and write IP addresses as a 32-bit number, we prefer to read them in dotted-decimal notation, which is basically the number split into 4 chunks of 8 bits, converted to decimal, and delmited by a dot.

In this kata, you will create the function ipToNum that takes an ip address and converts it to a number, as well as the function numToIp that takes a number and converts it to an IP address string. Input will always be valid.

Conversion Example
//original IP address
192.168.1.1

//breaks down into 4 binary octets
11000000 . 10101000 . 00000001 . 00000001

//which are merged together (unsigned 32-bit binary)
11000000101010000000000100000001

//and finally converted to base 10
3232235777
Note that the binary octets are unsigned (so we can't have negative numbers).
